# Fruition worker

![cicd-badge](https://github.com/cterence/fruition-worker/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg)

Cloudflare worker code for hosting my personal site : https://www.terence.cloud.

The worker is automatically redeployed after each push on main (I know, I'm crazy like that).

For more info, visit https://fruitionsite.com/ which is the main source of this code.

## Mods

I modified the code you can find on Fruition. Here is what I added :

- Sun/Moon emoji next to the light/dark mode toggle button
- Wider content size (between the 900px normal size and full width)
